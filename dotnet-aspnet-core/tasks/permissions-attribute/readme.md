## Requirements

* Create a simple web app with authorization like
  [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/secure-data?view=aspnetcore-2.2)
* Implement `ProfileController` with several actions:
  * Action that will return one profile by user Id
  * Action that will return a collection of profiles
  * Action that will add user profile to the collection
  * Action that will update user profile in the collection
  * Action that will delete user profile from collection
* Create `Permissions` enum that will have one separate permission for each `Action` from `ProfileController`. E.g.,
  `GetProfileById`, `GetProfiles` etc.
* Create attribute that will check if the authorized user has a permission for the specific `Action`. E.g.
  `[HasPermission(Permissions.GetProfileById)]`
* In case if the user doesn't have the required permission send corresponding error in response.
