# Rate Limit

## Short Description

Add an attribute to limit the number of concurrent requests to Action.

## Estimation (h)

32

## Topics

* ASP.NET Core
* Async methods
* Dependency Injection
* Sorting, Filtering and Paging
* Logging

## Requirements

* Create a `Profile` object that will contain the following properties:
  * Id (Guid)
  * FirstName
  * LastName
  * Birthday
* Create a `json-file` with a collection of profiles.
* Create a `ProfileService` class that will create a collection of profiles from json file and return it with paging,
  filtering and sorting.
* Use Dependency Injection to register class as a single instance.
* Inject it into the controller.
* Implement Action method that will call the `ProfilesService` to get profiles. The Action should support paging,
  filtering and sorting.
* Create `Profiles.cshtml` view that will have a simple table with the list of profiles with paging, filtering and
  sorting.
* Implement
  [custom action attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.mvc.actionfilterattribute?view=aspnet-mvc-5.2)
  that will restrict the number of concurrent requests to the Action. Make it configurable:
  * Developer should be able to specify the amount of allowed concurrent requests.
  * Return `429 (Too Many Requests)` when the number of requests is higher then the specified limit.
* To ease the implementation add some delay in the `ProfilesService` class or in the Action.
